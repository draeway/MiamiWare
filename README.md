# MiamiWare
MiamiWare is a fictitious home hardware / computer hardware store located in Miami, Florida. One of our tasks was to create a COVID-19 banner (alike many real websites), and also to create an 'account' portion where only the username 'user2033' and password 'letmein' were allowed (it would trigger a popup saying 'Welcome Back!'). Other usernames and passwords are not allowed and would trigger a 'shake' function that indicates wrong user/pass. On the other hand, new users can REGISTER for a new account, but their username has to be between {6,10} letters meanwhile the password has to have at least one letter and one number, and be more than 5 characters. 'Confirm Password' has to be the same value inputted for Password. If conditions are not met, there is a shake effect, indicating that it is wrong. If all conditions are met, there is an alert triggered that says 'Welcome Aboard!'
